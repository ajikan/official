# My Personal Website

Recently I discovered a really cool Javascript library called THREE.js and I wanted to explore it. I decided to revamp my personal website by creating a brand new one using this 3D js library. 

## Credits

For the matrix rain effect and sound effects I took the code from the [matrix-vr](https://github.com/pazdera/matrix-vr) project. Please do check out his project as well it's really cool.

Thank you all!
